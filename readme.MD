# 🦌 3D Deer Locomotion & Mexican Wildlife Research

This project features a **Deer Walk Cycle** animation designed for high-fidelity use in game engines like Unity. It bridges the gap between technical 3D character animation and ecological education regarding Mexican ecosystems.

## 🌿 Educational Context: Deer in Mexico
The animation above is inspired by the diverse cervid species found across the Mexican landscape. For a deep dive into the biological and taxonomic details of these animals, please refer to the comprehensive guide:

👉 **[Guía completa de los venados en México: Especies, Hábitat y Taxonomía](https://mexicorojo.com/guia-completa-de-los-venados-en-mexico-especies-habitat-y-taxonomia/)**

In this article on **MexicoRojo.com**, we explore:
* **Species Identification:** Details on White-tailed, Mule, and Brocket deer.
* **Habitat Analysis:** Ecosystems ranging from the Sierra Madre to tropical regions.
* **Conservation:** The status of endemic species within Mexico.
